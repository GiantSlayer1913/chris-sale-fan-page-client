Welcome to Chris Sale Fan Page Client ReadMe:

## Description:
This single page web application is fan page for the Red Sox Pitcher Chris Sale! Once signed-in a user can click through a custom designed photo slide show of Chris Sale, create, edit and delete comments they make and see all the comments other users have made.

## Technologies Used:
Languages: HTML & CSS, Javascripts, JQuery, Curl, AJAX Api.

Applications: Atom, NPM node modules

## Unsolved problems:
Would like to include Chris Sales' stats in a chart or table connected to Baseball Reference for future iterations.

## Strategies Implemented:
Pray everything works...just kidding. I tried my best to steer clear from attempting challenges that would have taken up too much time and focussed on featuring my CSS skills for this project. I still ran into some problems when creating the slideshow from scratch, but this was after overcoming serious obstacles working out my curl scripts and would not have completed the project without the help and guidance of my peers. The only real strategy that was steady throughout the project was not giving up no matter how dire the current problems were or how hard it was to overcome imposter syndrome eating at me mentally. I just held my ground and fought through it. Sometimes the only strategy is sheer grit and determination to see something through to the very end.
